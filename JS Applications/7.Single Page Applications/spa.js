// Single Page Applications SPA - Concepts and Implementation

// Sites and Applications

// A website is a collection of interlinked web pages:
//  - It hosts content, that is primarily meant to be consumed

// A web application is a software, accessible from a web browser:
//  - They are interactive and have rich functionality

// Multi Page Applications
// - Reloads the entire page
// - Displays the new page when a user interacts with the web app
// - When a data is exchanged, a new page is requested from the server to display in the web browser
// Pros:
//      - Performs well on the search engine
//      - Provides a visual map of the web app to the user
// Cons:
//      - Comparatively complex development
//      - Coupled backend and frontend


// Single Page Applications
//  - A next evolution from multi-page website
//  - Web apps that load a single HTML file
//  - SPAs use AJAX and HTML5 to create fluid and responsive Web apps
//  - No constant page reloads
