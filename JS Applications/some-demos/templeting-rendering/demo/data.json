To some, that is a humiliation for the side which conquered the world a year ago.For Klopp, it is merely the starting point on the path to getting back to where Liverpool belong. 'We have nothing to do with the title, (or) semi-finals and finals, we know that, but I don't feel bad because of it - that would be really weak,' he said.",
